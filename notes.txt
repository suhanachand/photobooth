okay so the basic plan of this wesbite is to be an online photobooth that works 
similarly where it has a displayy of the camara sees and once you start the photo 
clicking it will take photos in 20 second intervals for a total of 3 photos. then 
you can pick a template of your photo and save it as a pdf in the end, the design 
of the app would follow a white/black doodle design to be cute and simple.
